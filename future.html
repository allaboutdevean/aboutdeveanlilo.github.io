        <h3>Highschool</h3>
    <p>
        I think High School is going to be a BIG transition I will try my best to learn and do a great job but I am kind of worried because if I get a scholarship I can try to get into the olympics for me and my family I already have a great family I have a two story house with 1 dog and three cats and live in a great neighborhood but I want to give back because they do so much for me.
