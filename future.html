        <h3>Highschool</h3>
    <p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
     <p>
       My goals are to get good grades and make it in life and have a good career. I want to become a professional Tennis player if that dosen't work then I would like to become a Coder and if that doesn't work then I will major in Photography. I know my goals are a little hard to achieve. I belive in myself. If it's not meant to happen then it's not meant ot be.
