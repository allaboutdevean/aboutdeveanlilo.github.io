        <h3>Highschool</h3>
    <p>
        I think High School is going to be a BIG transition I will try my best to learn and do a great job but I am kind of worried because if I get a scholarship I can try to get into the olympics for me and my family I already have a great family I have a two story house with 1 dog and three cats and live in a great neighborhood but I want to give back because they do so much for me and also because I love tennis believe me if I didn't like it I would have quit a long time ago but I stayed becuause I love it is just so fun to do. I know that I already have a good life as is but I want to have a better one and give back to my loved ones to I don't feel bad so I Highschool I have to put my A game on a do my best.
