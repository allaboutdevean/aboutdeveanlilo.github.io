       <h2>Interests</h2>
   <p>
           My interests are drawing, technology, Some Sports like Volleyball and Tennis but anything else is a NO! I like those sports because that's really all the sports I used to play when I was a kid with my cousins it was so fun so I think volleyball and tennis are things I did when I was younger and I love it now. Drawing and Photography just came to me I love taking pictures it is just so crazy was you see sometimes but it's amazing, drawing I had a talent or drawing just love doing it it is just so calming to me I love it and so those are my interests.

       <h2>Culture</h2>
   <p>
       The extra thing that I wanted to talk about was my culture I love my culture I think it's an amazing culture where we do certain things that you won't see anywhere else. I have lots of family soe I haven't even met before because they live all across the world and sadly I haven't went all around the world so I will just have to wait but One thing I love about my family they are always there for me through thick and thin, we do a lot of different things lots of other people don't do like in funerals we give BIG mats to the other family and "some money" LOTS we show so beautiful mats you won't find at a market.
