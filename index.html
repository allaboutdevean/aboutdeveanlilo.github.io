        <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>
            My interests are drawing, using technology. The sports I like are Volleyball, Tennis, and Table Tennis. I like those sports becuase that's really all the sports I used to play when I was a younger with my cousins. Drawing and Photography are things that I am also insterested in. I love taking pictures it is just so crazy what you see sometimes but it's amazing. Drawing I had a talent for drawing when I was in 4th grade. I love drawing it's just so calming to me.
