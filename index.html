        <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>
            My interests are drawing, technology, Some Sports like Volleyball and Tennis but anything else is a NO! I like those sports becuase that's really all the sports I used to play when I was a kid with my cousins it was so fun so I think volleyball and tennis are things I did when I was younger and I love it now. Drawing and Photography just came to me I love taking pictures it is just so crazy what you see sometimes but it's amazing, drawing I had a talent for drawing I just love doing it is just so calming to me I love it and so those are my interests.
