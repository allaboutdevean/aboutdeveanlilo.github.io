      <h3>6th Grade</h3>
   <article>
   <p>
      I loved my 6th grade year because I learned lots of new things on a computer like google slides, google docs, the normal things on how to get around a computer. it is kind of funny because at first I was like come on lets get to the fun stuff. ATM is really helpful, I use it all the time in Middle School it's ridiculous. I dont know what I would do without ATM. ATM has been here for me for 3 years. I am proud to be apart of ATM and a great teacher like Ms. Milton

      <h3>7th Grade</h3>

     <p>
        My 7th Grade was really about building 3D models on our computers but there was more to 7th grade ATM than that. We learned Skethup, Floor Planner, Photoshop and a little bit of coding on karel. I loved 7th grade because I thought that we learned a lot of cool and amazing things that I will use in my life.

      <h3>8th Grade</h3>

     <p>
       Since I have returned as an 8th grader I have learned more about coding we have been coding our own websites and webpages on Visual Studio Code, and GitHub. I think these three years have been so hard for me. Learning coding was boring in the begining now that I actualy know how to code I LOVE!!! it's so fun however really hard at times. I love a good challenge.

     <h3>ATM Reflection</h3>
   <article>
   <p 
     I love my ATM class I have learned so much from this class. I don't know what I would do in Middle School without the amazing ATM. In the begining of my 6th grade year I wanted a different elective but my mom went behind my back and put me in this class. I thank her so much for that becuase technology is a big part of everyone's life. I would have missed out on opportunity of a lifetime. When I got in this class I didn't like it because I thought it was boring. Boring is my new word for excitment when it comes to ATM. If I had younger siblings I would advise them to commit to a 3 years of there life to ATM. I am willing to gossip about ATM.
