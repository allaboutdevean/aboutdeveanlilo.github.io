       <article>
The extra thing that I wanted to talk about was my culture I love my culture I think it's an amazing culture where we do certain things that you won't see anywhere else. I have lots of family soe I haven't even met before because they live all across the world and sadly I haven't went all around the world so I will just have to wait but One thing I love about my family they are always there for me through thick and thin, we do a lot of different things lots of other people don't do like in funerals we give BIG mats to the other family and "some money" LOTS we show so beautiful mats you won't find at a market.
