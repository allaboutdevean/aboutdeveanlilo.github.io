          <p>
             Today I will be talking about my culture. I am Samoan I love my culture it is a big part of my life. So let me tell you about us Samoans we love to put on shows and show people our traditional Samoan fire dance. I love seeing this dance. Most samoans get a Tatau which is also known as a tattoo in Samoa, they get it the old fashion way, which is a tattoo comb instead of a needle. Samoans we love to eat. I love Samoan food we eat taro, baked bananas, lots of different seafood fresh from the ocean, fresh coconut, milky mangos, very little vegetables.  We wear our island shirts also known as the aloha dress up shirts. I like to wear them sometimes at school, funerals and at parties. I love my culture and there is so much more to learn about my culture.
